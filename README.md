Yogularm 3D
===========

Yogularm 3D is a very early version of a Jump & Run Game that runs in your browser.

You can [Play the game](http://yogu.github.com/yogularm3d/) right now! I recommend using Google Chrome for best performance.

Use the arrow keys to move, the "A" key to jump and Ctrl to reset the camera. "F" toogles the view distance.

Have fun!

Also feel free to play [Yogularm Infinite](http://yogularm.de/software/yogularm), a 2D jump&run game.
